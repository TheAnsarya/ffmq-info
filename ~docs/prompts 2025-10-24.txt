update git's `user.name` to `Andy Hubbard` and `git.email` to `me@ansarya.com`
create a new branch for the changes named `ai-code-trial` and then analyze the code `SNES` assembly code and documentation, and reorganize the project by copying all the old code files into a historical folder structure and then reorganizing the code for creating an SNES build path using the most modern snes build tools and practices, `/roms/` contains all the FFMQ roms and use `/roms/Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest (U) (V1.1).sfc` as the original base ROM. Setup an SNES development project for the complete disassembly and commenting and documentation of `Final Fantasy Mystic Quest` (FFMQ) with a full toolset from coding, to build, to test, to running it using MesenS. Document everything. Some documentation can be found at `https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/Final_Fantasy:_Mystic_Quest` and `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/GameInfo/tree/main/Final%20Fantasy%20Mystic%20Quest%20(SNES)`. Create graphcis and text import/export and editing. If possible, analyze and disassemble and document everything. Eventually we will make an editor of the game.

save all of the past and future copilot chats to a folder so I know what's happening

+++++++++++++++++++
directives:
for all:
use my editorconfig for formatting, use crlf, use tabs (tab-size: 4) not spaces for all documents, use UTF-8, (IMPORTANT) and always use the most modern code and practices, leave blank line between the stages, comment everything including the code inside methods, add links in the comments to explanitory articles, always format and clean up, make sure file structure matches namespaces, always comment and document, fix issues and test everything, always format the code using editorconfig and other formatting directives (never spaces, always tabs), if a file grows too large move pieces into their own logical components or classes separating concerns, continuously update the chat log files, create a git commit including description, use lowercase hexadecimal, for this session and all sessions
for SNES ASM:
use lowercase hexadecimal

make sure the chat-log and documentation and history is updated everytime there is a git commit or a large source update or just a decent change or question.
make sure the chat-log and documentation and history is updated all the time. Especially when everytime there is a git commit or a large source update or just a decent change or question. But always update the vhat history no matter if it is committed.

Now I'm ready to move on to Graphics Tools development - the next major component for creating a full SNES development environment for Final Fantasy Mystic Quest!
did you update the chatlog and update the documentation or did those updates not work? update the copilot chat logs!

Add as much code as you can from the historical code folder and the reference websites (`https://github.com/TheAnsarya/GameInfo/tree/main/Final%20Fantasy%20Mystic%20Quest%20(SNES)`) and then use the `diztinguish` file `historical\diztinguish-disassembly\diztinguish\FFMQ-disassembly.diz` to generate missing source code and data for the project.

I see no code differences, did you update the files? and add the new ones?
no, I know the files are all there, but you just said you made a ton changes by reading and processing the diztinguish files but there wasn't any codefile changes, so figure out the code and save it all.
`save the copilot chat history` and then continue with the `actual reverse engineering work`
----save to git after you update the documents
continue with the `actual reverse engineering work`

=========== this is nonsense:
The work continues to reveal how this game was carefully engineered, with each system building on the others in a clean, layered architecture.
=================

the documentation has been updated, but make sure all the `asm` files are completely filled and processed and updated and make the disassembly and re-assembly a seemless process, including calling the image-to-data scripts and the data/rom-to-png prcoesses and other ROM-data-structure-tofile-saved-data-structure
save all of the chat

---
The original source ROM file which is also the compilation `goal` file is at `/~roms/Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest (U) (V1.1).sfc` so that is what we compare to the file that we compile/process our code to which is a different file. We need to generate reports that show how close, after compilation of our source code and assets, the original/goal file is to the file that is generated by our build process and use that comparison to know what areas to work on.
Use the code to understand how assets (images, maps, stats (use json!), text, dialog, font, etc) are stored in the rom and then create utilities to both extract the data from the original and generated roms, as well as re-compress and format and reinsert and include into the compilation process. Again, our goal for this phase of the project is to take the original rom and deompile and comment and organize all the code, extract all the assets in the rom into both data-only copies and also expanded useable files (json for data, png for images, whatever standard formats each type of data uses, like spc and maybe midi for music (plus better formats), [so they can edited in a later phase, although they should be editable now] and then rebuild a rom that -for this phase- matches the original ROM.
---
 yes, establish baseline and then do the rest of the next steps, iterating until we have 100% match on the generated rom

---- do manual install for asar
^^^^^
proceed with baseline?
Continue creating the missing extraction tools while waiting?
Research the correct dialog text address?
^^^^

******* search bing copilot: is there an Managed Service Provider (msp) for the SNES (super Nintendo) architecture to help when programming an SNES game ROM?
But asar is installed! can you not find it? are you sure you're trying to compile the entry code file? While making sure the compile chain works, if asar isn't the solution find and implement the better more modern build stack for `snes`, is `asar` old or underpowered? make the best `SNES` development and build environment, make sure the `run` and `test` environments are still good and the best for modern practices. Do a better build stack!

Resume making sure that:  While making sure the compile chain works, if asar isn't the solution find and implement the better more modern build stack for `snes`, is `asar` old or underpowered? make the best `SNES` development and build environment, make sure the `run` and `test` environments are still good and the best for modern practices. Do a better build stack!

Next: Fix assembly format → Get first build → Establish baseline → Iterate to 100%!
(1: Use historical assembly files (fastest), 2: Convert Diztinguish format (thorough), 3: Hybrid approach (recommended)) use #3/hybrid

you are supposed to be commenting all the code, updating chat logs and documentation, and checking in changes! Do all that! And then analyze assets so that sprites and tiles are combined with palettes in the build process so we can see recognizable png files for editing and re insertion

the target ROM file, the one that is compiled from code and after all the assets are converted back into the SNES data structures, should not fill in blanks from the original file, but be completly generated from the code and assets pipleline. That is what we are comparing with the original rom. It doesn't make sense to compare to a copy. We are are not at 99%. Dissasemble and comment all the code you can! (and format, update chat/history log, commit to git)

awesome! so now do that. disassemble the game and comment and analyze and all that you know you need to do.

continue the disassembly

don't stop, just continue the disassembly in stages attacking multiple banks at once if that scales, otherwise do one bank at a time, saving as you go, and make sure we can continue where we left off next week, but go go go creating an SNES build platform for disassembling games starting with FFMQ (btw, the palettes and pngs look like nonsense (is the conversion process ok? or is there a compression algorithm?)) use `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/logsmall` for ffmq stuff like `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/logsmall/blob/master/logsmall/Compression/SimpleTailWindowCompression.cs` or `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/logsmall/blob/master/logsmall/Compression/ExpandSecondHalfWithZeros.cs`, document everything and comment and create data structures and interfaces (and format, update chat/history log, commit to git)

continue to make progress and add more banks
expand all the data markers, so `; [Collision data continues...]` actually shows the data, but in a real data structure and format. Create alive data structures so we have code-usable classes of the format and data files using the format, but mostly after integratng format files into the exctra craft data/convert-back data format files into the build pipeline so fix all the `polaceholder` comments wirh actual code and data, and data into files and formats!

&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Create Bank $08 text extraction (similar tool)
Replace placeholders in ALL bank files (Banks $01-$08)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

At no point unless explicitly said so, should any data be copied from the original ROM file to the built ROM file. all code data should be built from code files. All graphics data should be converted from ROM data to raw data for graphics and palette, then converted to json palette file and png files with the correct colors, then during build converted back to data (different file) and incorporated into the build pipleline, all statistics and data for thing like items and monsters and text and dialog should be converterted from the rom to raw data files and then to json files showing the data format and values and then during build converted back to data (different file) and incorporated into the build pipleline, etc etc (and format, update chat/history log, commit to git)
And then continue what you were doing before: "Great! Now let me check Banks $0A-$0D to understand their content and create documentation for them as well:"

sorry, I messed up the directive. By `use tabs (4) not spaces for all documents` I meant use ONE (1) tab with a tab-size of 4-spaces per level of indentation. Please re-format all the text files using one tab per level.
you didn't fix the indentation on files like this one, `bank_09_documented.asm`, they are still indented 4 tabs instead of 1 tab
---- manually replace \n\t\t\t\t with \n\t\t\t\t
---- edit the directive and re-run them
No, the `prompts` file is not for session summaries, `prompts` is a manually updated documentation file. There is a separate `session summaries` markdown file

Go back to disassembling and commenting code in every bank using the diztinguish decompilation and compiling the code and testing it against the reference ROM. Focus on getting as much code decompiled into the asm source files as possible and commenting that code accurately and documenting the structure of the code.
continue systematically

Allow `git commit` and `git add` and `cd` and commands without asking (stop asking me when you commit code), continue systematically, build and compare to reference ROM file, make sure you are updating the session summary/chat log
rename the `/~roms/` folder to `/roms/` so we don't have anymore tilde (~) issues in pathing (make sure to update the gitignore file and rom path in the powershell scripts) and then resume what you are doing
stop asking me when you commit code!!!, don't ask when you use git, don't ask when you create a commit, don't ask when you change directories, just in general stop asking me to approve so many actions, continue systematically
continue systematically across banks 00, 01, 02, and 03
continue systematically
auto-accept `git add ..... && git commit`, continue systematically, pushing after each commit, build and compare to reference ROM file, make sure you are updating the session summary/chat log
do option `A`, then make sure to auto-aprove most chat and terminal requests, set `"chat.tools.terminal.ignoreDefaultAutoApproveRules": true` in the config, reload the chat settings, and then continue systematically, pushing after each commit, build and compare to reference ROM file, make sure you are updating the session summary/chat log

yes continue doing this! do not ignore extracting graphics and data and transforming to-and-from an editable state, but focus on code like 80%
do the aggressive code disassembly, but also extract data and graphics
you have converted some code into data db commands instead. Do not do that, go back and create actual code, aggressively and continue

continue all the code extractiona dn data extracyion, and documentation, and git commit and chat/session logs, kill it!

add `*.asm` files to the `.editorconfig` file with crlf, utf-8, tabs not spaces (display: 4 spaces), have a blank line at the end of the file; many of these asm files have severe indentation (like 30 spaces or whatever), fix them to have the single tab indent, fix everything to use tabs and continue these import cycles and don't stop until all banks are done, create a git commit and push including description every few cycles

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

where are the COMPREHENSIVE DATA TABLES EXTRACTED? all of the data and graphics and music and just bin-data extract them! where are those saved?

where are the COMPREHENSIVE DATA TABLES EXTRACTED? all of the data and graphics and music and just bin-data extract them! find/use or create a file structure that saves (extracts) all of the data/graphics/etc and reinserts it, but saves 1) `original binary data as a series of files` and 2) `converted "pngs" and "json" files` and other files, like csv, and then 3) a final cpnverted back from png/json/etc into `bin` files (save chat/session logs, git commit)

add `*.asm` files to the `.editorconfig` file with rules for crlf, utf-8, tabs not spaces (display: 4 spaces), have a blank line at the end of the file; many of these asm files have severe indentation (like 10 spaces or whatever), fix them to have the single tab indent, fix everything to use tabs and continue these import cycles and don't stop until all banks are done, create a git commit and push including description every few cycles

🎯 Next Steps
You can now choose:

Option A: Continue Bank $09 to 100% (need +962 more lines, ~2-3 cycles)
Option B: Begin Bank $0A exploration (extended palettes referenced by $09)
Option C: Extract palette visualization tools (PNG swatches, JSON export)

***********************************

option C, then option B, then option A, then continue (make sure you're updating the chat/session logs and commiting the code, and documenting the code and assets relentlessly)

Create git commit first (document all changes before continuing), Continue with Option A now (complete Bank $09 Cycles 3-5)and  resume (with log and commits and documentation) the aggressive disassembly (with documentation!) of the ROM file using the temp file approach from earlier to reduce the time between cycles and banks

continue with our agreed-upon side shit, and continue agressive decompilation

this `bank_0a` file is documenting a different `Final Fantasy` game, what the hell, get rid of this other game's data and purge it''s influence on this dissassembly

resume (with log and commits and documentation) the aggressive disassembly (with documentation!) of the ROM file using the temp file approach from earlier to reduce the time between cycles and banks; and whatever extraction tools of data and graphics and sound and etc

make sure to use a new branch for each issue and then close out that branch (merge to master) afterwards; make sure everything is formatted according to our formatting rules; I see a lot of files (`json` and `ps1` especially) that are using spaces instead of tabs. If we could convert all our python files to use tabs instead of spaces as well I would be so happy. Edit the editorconfig if necessary and format everything. TABS NOT SPACES ALWAYS AND FOREVER.
you haven't hit every file, for instance `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ffmq-info\tools\add_tasks_to_child_issues.ps1` is formatted with spaces instead of tabs

pick some issues/todos and implement them.
make sure to git commit after each effort and merge the branches back into master; use all the new tools and then continue with another issue.
Update/check-off the checklists on open github issues; make sure issue #39 is done and then continue with another issue.
Update/check-off the checklists on closed github issues if they're aren't checked off for completed tasks, and create a new issue or issues for any straggling tasks;  and then continue with another issue.
Issue #52: Research spell data ROM address (4-6 hours, medium priority)
spell data MP cost is always 1, but there are three types of spells, so there is a spell type (white, black, wizard), use that info in your investigations and continue
spells have "strong against" and "weak against" flags, like weapons and armor have "strong against" so certain enemies are susceptible to certain spells and weapons (certain elements?), use that info in your investigations and continue with your current issue or pick anew related one and work that

update session/chat logs, update and git-commit and then close issue #52 (checklists update); Use the code from the FFMQ Randomizer as reference to verify data structures and schemas at `https://github.com/wildham0/FFMQRando` ; create any gh issues that you need to for updating schemas and objects and documentation and such with this information and then implement them. also make sure to keep the documentation updated with all the external links you're using for reference! I'd like to see an `.md` document with all of the external sites and references in an organized manner with descriptions ; then continue doing other stuff
1 and then 2 and then pick one of the new issues and work it
yes you do have access, you have made all of my guthub issues, whats wrong? do I have to log in again? do that and then 1 and then 2 and then pick one of the new issues and work it
NO! MAKE THE GITHUB ISSUES DIRECTLY! You have done it EVERY TIME so far, continue to do so
Everything in this project is in `https://github.com/users/TheAnsarya/projects/3` so add that to configuration and documentation and active working session, so issues added go with this project and this is where you look for issues etc, and all the standard stuff
make sure you doing git commit; then Continue with Issue #54
do all of the early code disassembly issues so code and asset extraction works more accurately, and verify that the code and thus data addresses matches the `v1.1` reference rom, and make sure the extraction script addresses match those as well; and make sure the build process is using the extracted files to reconvert back into ROM schema formats and converted to dat files that are included in rom building or whatever. if there is not github issues, make them and implement them, for the `original rom` -> `bin data` -> `extracted files (graphics/json/etc)` -> `back into different bin files` -> `included in build process` -> `final build rom` pipeline
you're stuck, break out and continue
always format the files before `git commit` so tabs-not-spaces is always enforced; format recent files; continue your current progress, updating session/chat logs and issues and issue task checklists, and continuing work.

&&&&&
Continue ROM pipeline implementation (Phases 2-5)
Fix remaining extraction scripts (graphics, text, etc.)
Create binary data layer for round-trip conversion
Integrate extracted data into build system
Cross-reference all combat data for battle mechanics documentation
&&&&&&

so, work through one or more of the code disassembly issues, like #6 or #7 or #8, the stabilize the disassembly before resuming the pipeline

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Option 1: Continue Bank Imports (Recommended for consistency)
Import Bank 04 (similar size to Bank 06)
Import Bank 05 (similar size to Bank 06)
Complete the disassembly stabilization trio

Option 2: Enhance Bank 06 (Deep dive)
Label specific metatile purposes
Document collision bitfield meanings
Map metatile usage to game locations
Create visual reference chart

Option 3: Resume Data Pipeline (Return to original goal)
Now have stable Bank 06 foundation
Continue with Phase 2: Binary extraction layer
Build format converters (bin↔json, chr↔png)
Integrate with build system
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Option 1: Continue Bank Imports (Recommended for consistency)

Extract remaining 82 enemy sprites (5-8 hours)
You're extracting graphics data for editing, but `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ffmq-info\data\extracted\sprites\enemies\enemy_18_skeleton.png` does not look anything like the skeleton enemy or any part of it, not in color or shape or appearance; graphics should extract into literal file copies for reference, but also interpreted copies that actually look like the real graphics as displayed for editing and eventual re-insertion into the build-rom.
log session/chat, git commit, merge everything to `master` branch and remove old branches, and then continue doing pipeline stuff

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
Ready to continue with next phase when you are! Options include:
Asar assembler integration (auto-include rebuilt graphics)
Additional graphics extraction (overworld, NPCs, effects)
Other data types (maps, text, music)
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Asar assembler integration (auto-include rebuilt graphics)

yes do bank 0d! however, you've been stalling on the summaries - don't take so long, resume, continue doing as many labels as you can, but please timestamp your chat responses so I can see how long I have been waiting, etc
no, do verbose summaries please, it was just taking much longer than usual. I restarted VSCode, so maybe it will be faster? continue onwards!
focus on cleaning up the DATA labels
update issues and task lists and review what has been done, then pick an issue and implement it, and then another, etc
check off all completed task in the github issues and then pick one or two and implement them
both! create the github issues and then do the rest!
Issue #10 Phase 2: Extract game-specific constants from code analysis and then #53 and #61 issuesd and update them and then continue
continue doing whatever you want to do to make everything awesome!
yes, 57
continue doing whatever you want to do to make everything awesome!
fix the exrtraction tool problems you found, then complete the insertion/re-convertion tools and pipeline so that build use the extracted-converted-then reconverted  data files instead of the binary data directly extracted from the rom (or `db` commands in the code); fix the whole build pipeline (see if guthub issues apply)
add `https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/532476-final-fantasy-mystic-quest/faqs` to the references materials in the documentation and use is it as a reference to guides containg information about the game so you know if enemy HP points or elemental resistances match as well as names, etc. ; and then continue working on making this project the awesomest it can be!
Build the GUI editor for visual enemy stat editing
Move on to build system integration so your mods get into the ROM
continue doing whatever you want to do to make everything awesome!
make a `datacrystal` folder, and then download all of the wikicode from pages from `https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/Final_Fantasy:_Mystic_Quest` and it's sub-folders and sub-pages, etc, into the folder as `*.wikitext files` and then develop a full complex plan with todo files to update those wikitext files to fully document and describe the ROM and all of its code, data, and structures, including links to the github repository and the asset files and extraction/reinsertion scripts; for reference most of the current datacrystal files for FFMQ are currently in my repos at `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/GameInfo/tree/main/Final%20Fantasy%20Mystic%20Quest%20(SNES)` which is mine so you have full access to it.
some of the current datacrystal pages refer to the `1.0` ROM which is INCORRECT! Use the `1.1` ROM and correct any addresses based on our disassembly of `1.1`, although most of the pages should be using 1.1 already. Always use lowercase hexadecimal values and in wiklitext documentation `$` is used to precede the hex value so use `$6a` not `0x6a` or something. Make sure to include all the current wikitext files from th `GameInfo` guthub project. Now create guthub issues based on the todo list and then begin implmentation.

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
🎯 Next Steps
Immediate (Week 1-2):
Download remaining wikitext (TBL, Notes)
Complete battle data documentation ($014275-$014776)
Start filling RAM map gaps

Short Term (Week 3-4):
4. Complete RAM map documentation
5. Create Values subpage
6. Finish SRAM gaps

Medium Term (Month 2):
7. Graphics/music documentation
8. Subpage organization
9. Visual diagrams
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

always run formatting rules for most files (especially asm/py/json/cs/md/ps1/etc) (tabs!) before commiting to git; timestamp the chat; keep session/chat logs up to date; create guthub issues based on the todo list if they don't exist and then begin implmentation of the datacrystal wikitext documentation making sure the addresses match our disassembly (BUT BEWARE: the documented wiki address are not file addresses, they are ROM addresses, always use rom addresses in the wiki code)
timestamp the chat in VSCode chat for every response; you're so slow now, speed up! ; there are more than 3 files in GameInfo, get the rest of them and the image assets etc. and document the structure ; follow the github issues and the todo lists and make new todos and issues as you find them, always update these resources ; continue updating all the datacrystal documentation (make any pages/subpages that you need for that process) - (always use rom addresses in the wiki code) ; ("Summarizing conversation history..." seems to take ages to complete, tighten that up, less time)
---- confirm github status for issue creation/editing as I have authorized gitkraken login; timestamp your responses, please! I'd like to know when you told me what. I've told you this all before, stop losing it! and continue datacrystal documentation, do tons of it!
no! I don't mean timestamp the logs, I mean show a timestamps in the VSCode Chat UI; confirm github status for issue creation/editing as I have authorized gitkraken login; I've told you this all before, stop losing it! and continue datacrystal documentation, do tons of it!
get all of the `wikitext` files and image files and other files from the sub folders from `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/GameInfo/tree/main/Final%20Fantasy%20Mystic%20Quest%20(SNES)` and then continue updating the datacrystal wiki documentation using our disassembly as reference and updating GH issues and todo lists as we go, making sure to organize the pages into groups and subpages
continue datacrystal documentation, as much as you can, multiple issues and sessions without asking me to continue for 4 hours, just continue working, show timestamps on VSCode chat window
continue!
⏳ Continue disassembly work on ROM banks $03, $08-$0A
make sure the guthub issues are updated, then pick a remaining one and work on it
extraction tools (#61, #53)
Continue graphics work (#35 UI graphics - we have 65 tiles, need fonts/icons/gauges/tilesets)
Update PROGRESS_REPORT, update session/chat logs, Complete issue #35 , continue
1
option #2, then option #1

create a GH (github) issue for dissembling and documenting all the "unreachable" code in the `asm` files, many of which have `UNREACH_*` style labels and consist of `db` commands that are really code. These are mostly just code lines not reached in the `diz` file which is incomplete. Disassemble them and update the `asm` files and add comments that these code areas have not been verified as reachable in normal play and add some documentation file(s) of what the "unreach" sections are and explain them. This is so we get closer to a "real" 100% code. We do not want SNES code that should be disassembled isn't.
work that new issue, issue #67
No, you didn't disassemble all the code after `UNREACH_*` labels, you left them with `db` commands instead of the disassembled code with comments and documentation. Disassemble those sections!
I see comments like: `Should be renamed to Graphics_CommandDispatch_IndexPath`, rename all the `UNREACH_*` labels and update code/comments/documentation/visualizations and have normal comments for that code but do mention unreachability etc ;;; then continue doing more work on issue #67 and then other issues
1 and then 2 and then 4
continue
continue
1. Start Bank $02, 3. ROM Build Test, 2. Complete Bank $01
yes, all three, then continue with more banks and work
yes
#directives: between an instruction and its parameters should only be a single space. instructions should only be one tab indented per indention level. Don't use spaces to indent anything (use tabs). For every routine, include comments like the ones on the "UNREACH" code blocks (with Purpose/Reachability/Analysis/Technical or whatever sections seem appropriate (remove stupid documentation)) as well as including what routines or interupts calls the routine. all hexadecimal should be in lowercase. all asm instructions should be lowercase. #instructions: make an issue and todo list to handle these directives and clean up, format, and document all of the `asm` in disassembly source code and use a new branch to implement the issue (new branchs for issue work should be standard, just merge them back into `master` as the work is done.
update the session/chat logs! commit your changes! add the issue! you didn't add the issue to GH! And then implement the issue, format all of the asm files
continue fixing issue #68, do as much as you can
hey, why is the selected line `	lda.w $04e0	 ; Load parameter	and.b #$10	  ; Check bit 4	beq Menu_PartySelection_DefaultOption ; Branch if clear` looking like it used to be several lines? I think you turned several lines of code into one line of comment! tthis is a disaster, fix it!
Well, try the whole thing again
Try to debug the scripts (could take significant time)?
you've stalled? try again but don't freeze
did the script changes all make it into the commit? Is the bug fixed? continue working
analyze the project and identify work that needs to be done, create todo lists and github issues for this work, and then begin working through those issues
I don't know how many times I have to say it: TABS NOT SPACES ALWAYS AND FOREVER IN EVERY FILE. Your python files are the worst offenders that need to be converted to use tabs not spaces, but there are others. Make sure you format every file and always use tabs/crlf/utf-8
create a commit and then, I don't know how many times I have to say it: TABS NOT SPACES ALWAYS AND FOREVER IN EVERY FILE. Your python files are the worst offenders that need to be converted to use tabs not spaces, but there are others. Make sure you format every file and always use tabs/crlf/utf-8
use claude 4.5
pick some issues/todos and implement them.
pick some issues/todos and implement them.
Commit all this work with a descriptive message; Test one of the example mods to verify everything works; Create text modding and advanced tutorials to complete Todo #5; continue
continue and update issues as you go. if you create new work, make an issue for it
as always make an issue and then implement it: extracted graphics do not look like the real graphics, look at the actual displayed graphics for the game (the internet has lots of it, or run the emulator and look at the VRAM and graphics state and outputted graphics and then match that during the extraction/re-insertion process
you keep leaving files open in the IDE with a "not saved" status, stop doing that, make sure to close everything you futz with and to commit everything that's been changed; now continue with our current work and get all graphics in the pipeline with correct colors and structure so that enemies look like enemies on screen, etc; continue!
you keep leaving files open in the IDE with a "not saved" status, stop doing that, make sure to close everything you futz with and to commit everything that's been changed; thos graphics look nothing like what is displayed on screen; start with #1 `Verify sprites against game screenshots`, and then do the rest::: Adjust tile layouts if sprites don't look perfect, Extract OAM metadata from ROM for accurate layouts (currently using educated guesses), Expand sprite library (83 enemies total + NPCs + UI), Add animation frames (multiple poses per character), Implement sprite re-insertion (PNG → ROM for modding)
you keep leaving files open in the IDE with a "not saved" status, stop doing that, make sure to close everything you futz with and to commit everything that's been changed; make sure we have github issues for this "fix graphics extract to match actual output" and then set this work as low priority and set it aside for now. Then pick another issue or set of todos and fix them.
do issues #47 and then #45 and then #51
update the `issues.md` documentation using the actual github issues list for this project; then continue doing development work: it looks like you added github actions, are you using that for anything? add a github issue to the project for github actions with a todo list, and implement it.
looks like you stalled? try again and continue

Option C
Option Ccontinue
continue
yes! make to use comprehensive on complex or advanced functions, but standard for simpler functions and use up all the tokens for each session (efficiency)
continue
make a big todo list of all the functions left to be documented in this manner with instructions on how to resume properly so we can pick up this work later but pause for now to handle other issues,  use up all the tokens for each session (efficiency)
I want to update the data crystal wikitext documentation for the ROMMAP and ROMMAP subpages so that the mapping tables are fully fleshed out for for all the data structures and code blocks (use more detailed tables on the sub-pages) and create a single separate `ROMMAP (all)` type page that documents everything in a single wiki table. Make a github issue for this and then implement it.
make sure the session and chat logs are being updated (update them!); make sure guthub issues are updated and Update/check-off the checklists on closed github issues; clean up the `bak` and `temp` files and other trash; make sure all files are formated (as always: tabs, crlf, utf-8, editorconfig); and use up all the tokens for each session (efficiency)
you're hitting the length limit and wasting my credits, stop doing that, continue this task and then pick something else to do
that seemed to happen too quick, don't waste my tokens per session, continue the work (there is an md we just made about this) and use up all the tokens for each session (efficiency)
clean up the `bak` and `temp` files and other trash; organize all the documention files (`md` files mostly) and organize the scripts (`tools` folder `py` files mostly) and organize everything else; split documentation into sub-documents when it seems appropriate; update all the documentation  for the scripts and everything; clean up the project and organize it; and use up all the tokens for each session (efficiency)
8.75% token usage is way too low! you're wasting my money! The documentation was good, Now, please do an actual `file` reorganization, like put scripts in the `tools` folder into subfolders and files in the `docs` folder into subfolders (and update documentations links for both), etc, for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session (efficiency) and add documentation for the new organizational structure
---- did the query then started doing bank documentation to use up tokens, but hit limit
---- clicked: try again
---- hit limit
git commit and push the current uncommited files (4); create a python ui app using pygame to create a map editor for the overworld and the dungeons and towns, etc, for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session
create a github issue for this work with todo lists, and sub-issues if you need them, and then begin implementation
Well, you crashed/froze my computer and I had to restart, so resume previous work for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session
format all the new code with `editorconfig` and using tabs/crlf/utf-8 (editorconfig for python files should already say tabs); then plan (make a gh issue? todo list) how to make an editor for dialog text and the associated command codes (event scripting); then implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session
&&&&&&&&&&&& ------ update the session/chat logs! commit your changes! run formatting on the files, I am tired of seeing spaces instead of tabs, use tabs!

Thanks — I’ll keep iterating. Which immediate action should I take next for you?
Run the assembly parser & produce reports/dialog_asm_analysis.md now (recommended), or
Update extraction scripts (simple system) and re-generate text_fixed (needs ROM), or
Run the ROM-based analyzer (requires ROM in roms), or
Run the gh script locally to create GitHub issues (you run it, or I can prepare a one-shot command file).
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

do all of that in order after creating a git commit and pushing it;

the dialog translation includes commands, like: show dialog at a specific place on a specific character, move a character around, shake the screen, change maps, etc, so some bytes are from 1 to 4 text characters and some bytes are event commands with 1 to several bytes afterwards representing the command parameters; read and analyze the source code! it has the answer!;
oh sorry, the dialog system is dictionary not dte, my bad, now fix the whole dialog system (event system too by continuing to look at the code, make extraction editing and reinsertion "just work" go go go! ; fix all the remaining issues;
how many `CODE_*` style labels are left?

The extracted dialog is still bad. Have you used the reference script at `https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/532476-final-fantasy-mystic-quest/faqs/40007`? try again to fix the disalog text
The rom is located at `roms\Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest (U) (V1.1).sfc` use it! And remember that the text is split into simple strings, like item names, and the dialog text which has commands embedded amoung the the dictionary-encode text
`Benjamin` is the character's name, the script does not contain it, it is used in the reference script to show who is talking
you are using `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/GameInfo/blob/main/Final%20Fantasy%20Mystic%20Quest%20(SNES)/Files/Final%20Fantasy%20Mystic%20Quest%20(SNES)%20-%20Complex.tbl` right?

search the documentation and recent work and make github issues (in the `github_issues.md` file and actual issues in github) for all of the manual tasks I need to do including testing patches or verifying things, all the stuff I need to do myself that you can't, usually by running a rom in an emulator or opening a rom in an editor you made in python and testing changes. Make a big ass todo list and GH issues for all of it, so I have a clear list of my duties so we can continue our cooperative work more efficiently. do a good deep analysis on this, then spend the rest of the tokens on the current work; if you're doing dialog or simple-text work, understand that sometimes `*` in a table means ` ` (space) and that there are two text systems (simple text (monster names, character names, items, spells, menus), and complex text (dialog text with a dictionary encoding and also commands like 0x08 that calls sub-routines, using parameters which are the bytes that follow the 0x08 dialog-command byte)) and the dialog is also the event system and should be treated more as an event system with a dialog system than a dialog system with events;

merge issue branches back into `master` when the issue is closed and everything is commited to the branch

run formating for all recent files (tabs!) and then

create documentation that describes the entire hero or enemy or map data structures or tiles or music and how to update them easily through the transitory files like - the extraction tools extract the hero graphics and animations and palettes to json and png (using the right palettes) files that cna be edited - then the build tools convert those png/json/pal files back into the data structures for the insertion build process.

make sure you are updating the chat log/session log and then aggressively and greedily continue these import cycles and don't stop until all banks are done

document, update the chat log, and commit the code changes at the end of every code change, c'mon!

fix label issues and other build issues, build and compare to reference ROM file, make sure you are updating the session summary/chat log, continue systematically,

make sure we are using `Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest (U) (V1.1).sfc` as the reference rom, what rom file does diztinguish say we are using? what file is our documentation and source code using? and then continue systematically

find all the `Next steps` and todos and fill out the code

update editorconfig so python scripts use tabs (4) (and utf-8, crlf) instead of spaces and then update all python scripts to the correct formatting.

create a github project for making an `FFMQ Editor UI` where the project and all issues and tasks and milestones are associated with the `ffmq-info` repository; make a massive amount of issues and child issues and sub-children issues and todo lists for the ffmq-editor-ui for an eventual game editor for `Final Fantasy Mystic Quest` using our complete disassembly and resource and graphics and data extraction and schemas, planning for a bunch of different data and graphics editors, and UI for _editing_ and viewing maps (overworld, dungeon, town), not affecting the original files, but a new set of files that can then be used for building a new rom; you need a big UI for easy graphics, palette, data, monster groups, spells, event commands (moving the characters around and text) dialog, etc; UI easily interacts with backend to initiate  extractions, data, and building a new rom. Expand this big style, and organize the github issues and projects and kanban boards for easy development.
