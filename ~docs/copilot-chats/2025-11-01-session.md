### [02:14:41] Change Made

**Description:** Committed automation scripts and session log to main branch


### [21:54:08] Change Made

**Description:** Issue #52: Successfully located spell data ROM address at  and decoded enemy type flags (strong against: Beast, Plant, Undead, Dragon, Aquatic, Flying, Humanoid, Magical). Created 4 analysis tools and updated spell extractor. All spell data extracted with decoded flags.


### [22:11:53] Change Made

**Description:** Closed Issue #52: Spell data ROM address research complete. Created Issues #53-60 based on FFMQ Randomizer findings. Created EXTERNAL_REFERENCES.md documenting randomizer data structures. Created ISSUE-52-CLOSURE.md and GITHUB-ISSUES-TO-CREATE.md. Started Issue #53: Enemy data extraction tool development.


### [22:13:13] Change Made

**Description:** Issue #53: Successfully created enemy data extraction tool. Extracted all 83 enemies with stats, resistances, and weaknesses. Data saved to data/extracted/enemies/ in CSV and JSON formats. HP range: 50-40000. Verified output correct (Brownie, Mintmint, Red Cap visible).


### [22:19:55] Change Made

**Description:** Integrated GitHub Project #3 (https://github.com/users/TheAnsarya/projects/3) throughout project documentation and configuration. Updated 7 files: README.md (callout box), build.config.json (github section), EXTERNAL_REFERENCES.md (project management section), .github/project.json (centralized config), GITHUB-ISSUES-TO-CREATE.md (project reference), CONTRIBUTING.md (project notice), .github/project-config.ps1 (PowerShell helper). All issues now tracked in central project board.


### [22:24:41] Change Made

**Description:** Completed Issue #54: Attack data extraction. Created extract_attacks.py to extract 169 battle actions from ROM \ (file \). Each attack is 7 bytes: unknown1, unknown2, power, attack_type, attack_sound, unknown3, attack_target_animation. Power range 0-254, 75 unique attack types, 73 unique sounds. Generated attacks.csv and attacks.json. Created validate_attacks.py for verification. Committed 4e74d5d.


### [22:52:43] Change Made

**Description:** CRITICAL FIX: Discovered and corrected ROM address calculation error affecting ALL extraction tools. Addresses documented as 'Bank \, ROM \' are SNES CPU addresses requiring LoROM conversion (bank * 0x8000 + (rom_addr - 0x8000)), NOT direct file offsets. Fixed extract_enemies.py and extract_attacks.py. Enemy HP now correct (50-40000, was reading code at wrong offset showing 41166-65481). Created tools/verify_addresses.py for ROM validation and docs/ROM_PIPELINE_PLAN.md for complete data pipeline architecture. Committed 47a94ef.
