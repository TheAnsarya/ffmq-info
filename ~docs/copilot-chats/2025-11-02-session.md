## Activity Log


### [00:11:02] Change Made

**Description:** CRITICAL FIX: Enemy sprites now extract with CORRECT colors! Discovered previous extraction used wrong palettes (Bank 05 generic vs Bank 09 enemy-specific). Skeleton and all enemies looked wrong. Created extract_enemy_palettes.py (201 lines) to extract 83 enemy palettes from Bank 09 @ \. Each enemy has dedicated 8-color RGB555 palette. Created reextract_enemies_correct_palettes.py (263 lines) to re-extract ALL 83 enemies with proper palettes. Palette swaps now work correctly (Ice Golem blue, Fire Golem red). Updated 166 files. Generated massive 1152×11,088px enemy catalog. Sprites now match in-game appearance - literal file copies with accurate colors for editing and re-insertion. Graphics pipeline produces production-quality extractions!


### [00:43:12] Note

**Note:** Session complete: Graphics extraction pipeline 100% done with production-quality results. All 83 enemies extracted with correct Bank 09 palettes. Ready to merge to master and begin Phase 2 (build integration).


### [00:44:19] Change Made

**Description:** Merged branch 52-spell-data-address to master with complete graphics extraction pipeline. Deleted all merged local branches. Master now has production-quality graphics extraction with all 83 enemies, character sprites, UI elements, and comprehensive documentation. Branch cleanup: removed 27 merged branches. Ready to begin Phase 2 (build integration pipeline).


### [00:44:26] Note

**Note:** Starting Phase 2: Build Integration Pipeline. Created branch 83-build-integration-pipeline. Goal: Create PNG→ROM import tools to enable round-trip graphics editing workflow.
