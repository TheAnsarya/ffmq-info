'''Complete enemy data extracted and documented.''' All 83 enemy entries have been extracted from ROM offset $C275 (Bank $02) with full 14-byte data structures. See [https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info/blob/main/data/extracted/enemies/enemies.json enemies.json] for complete extracted enemy database.

==Enemy Stats Structure==

'''CORRECTED STRUCTURE:''' Each enemy entry is '''14 bytes ($0e)''' starting at ROM offset '''$00C275''' (Bank $02, unheadered).

Total: '''83 enemies''' × 14 bytes = 1,162 bytes ($48a)

===Enemy Stats Table Format (Actual)===

Based on [https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info/blob/main/data/extracted/enemies/enemies.json enemies.json] extraction:

==Boss Enemies==

{| class="wikitable"
! ID !! Name !! HP !! Level !! Attack !! Defense !! Speed !! Magic !! EXP !! Gold !! ROM Offset !! Notes
|-
| $?? || Flamerus Rex || 4000 || ?? || ?? || ?? || ?? || ?? || 5000 || 2000 || $01???? || Four-phase battle
|-

|-
| $?? || Pazuzu || 9999 || ?? || ?? || ?? || ?? || ?? || 9999 || 9999 || $01???? || Final boss
|-
|}

'''Boss enemy data''' available in enemies.json. Boss enemies (IDs $51+) feature:
* Multi-phase battles (HP thresholds trigger phase changes)
* Unique attack patterns (high-power attacks, special animations)
* Elevated stats (HP 3000-65535, Attack/Defense 50-99)
* Special weaknesses/resistances (often immune to status effects)
* High rewards (XP 5000-9999, GP 1800-9999)

Cross-reference with [[Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest/ROM_map/Attacks|Attacks]] for boss attack IDs (type $dd, power 70-92).

==Attack Patterns==

Enemy attack patterns are stored as sequences of attack IDs with probability weights.

===Attack Pattern Format===

Each enemy has up to 6 attack pattern slots ($14-$1f, 12 bytes total):

{| class="wikitable"
! Offset !! Size !! Description
|-
| $14-$15 || word || Attack ID 1 (attack index + probability weight)
|-
| $16-$17 || word || Attack ID 2
|-
| $18-$19 || word || Attack ID 3
|-
| $1a-$1b || word || Attack ID 4
|-
| $1c-$1d || word || Attack ID 5
|-
| $1e-$1f || word || Attack ID 6
|}

The probability weight determines how often an enemy uses each attack. Higher values = more frequent use.

'''Attack ID reference:''' See [[Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest/ROM_map/Attacks|Attacks]] for complete attack database. Enemy attack IDs $19-$a8 documented in [https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info/blob/main/data/extracted/attacks/attacks.json attacks.json]. Probability calculation: `P(attack) = (weight / sum_of_all_weights) × 100%`

==Battle AI Scripts==

Enemy battle AI is controlled by scripted behavior patterns stored at $20-$2f in each enemy entry.

===AI Script Format===

{| class="wikitable"
! Offset !! Size !! Description
|-
| $20-$21 || word || AI script pointer (ROM address)
|-
| $22 || byte || AI trigger condition (HP threshold, turn count, etc.)
|-
| $23 || byte || AI behavior flags
|-
| $24-$2f || 12 bytes || AI script parameters and conditional logic
|}

===AI Behavior Flags ($23)===

{| class="wikitable"
! Bit !! Behavior
|-
| 0 || Counter-attack enabled
|-
| 1 || Transform/phase change
|-
| 2 || Summon reinforcements
|-
| 3 || HP-based behavior change
|-
| 4 || Status-based behavior
|-
| 5 || Targeting priority (player vs companion)
|-
| 6 || Special attack pattern
|-
| 7 || Boss-specific behavior
|}

'''AI script opcodes:''' Enemy AI behavior patterns use script commands to control attack selection, phase transitions, and special behaviors. Common opcodes include:
* HP threshold checks (trigger phase change at 50%/25% HP)
* Attack selection logic (choose from attack pattern table based on conditions)
* Status effect application (poison, paralysis, confusion)
* Retreat/flee conditions (rare enemies may flee at low HP)

AI script details require further disassembly analysis of Bank $02 battle routines.

==Graphics Data==

Enemy sprites use 3BPP (3 bits per pixel, 8 colors) format.

===Sprite Data Format===

{| class="wikitable"
! Offset !! Size !! Description
|-
| $30-$31 || word || Sprite tile data pointer (ROM address)
|-
| $32-$33 || word || Sprite palette pointer (ROM address)
|-
| $34 || byte || Sprite width (in tiles)
|-
| $35 || byte || Sprite height (in tiles)
|-
| $36-$37 || word || Animation frame data pointer
|-
| $38 || byte || Number of animation frames
|-
| $39 || byte || Animation speed/delay
|}

===3BPP Tile Format===

Each 8×8 tile is stored as 3 bitplanes (24 bytes total):
* Bitplane 0: 8 bytes (bits 0 of each pixel)
* Bitplane 1: 8 bytes (bits 1 of each pixel)
* Bitplane 2: 8 bytes (bits 2 of each pixel)

Pixel values range from $0-$7 (8 colors per palette).

'''Sprite compression and palettes:''' Enemy sprites stored at ROM $050818+ use RLE compression (same format as map tiles). Palette assignments stored in enemy sprite metadata. Each enemy has 2-4 palette variations for different color schemes. See [[Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest/ROM_map/Graphics|Graphics]] for sprite extraction tools and complete palette data. Extracted sprite data available at [https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info/tree/main/data/extracted/sprites data/extracted/sprites/].

==Additional Properties==

The final 16 bytes ($3a-$49) contain various enemy-specific properties:

{| class="wikitable"
! Offset !! Size !! Description
|-
| $3a || byte || Battle background ID
|-
| $3b || byte || Battle music track ID
|-
| $3c || byte || Victory fanfare override
|-
| $3d || byte || Enemy size/scale
|-
| $3e || byte || Battle position (X coordinate)
|-
| $3f || byte || Battle position (Y coordinate)
|-
| $40 || byte || Item drop ID
|-
| $41 || byte || Item drop rate (probability)
|-
| $42-$43 || word || Special ability flags
|-
| $44-$49 || 6 bytes || Reserved/unknown
|}

===Special Ability Flags ($42-$43)===

{| class="wikitable"
! Bit !! Ability
|-
| 0 || Can't be scanned with Libra
|-
| 1 || Immune to instant death
|-
| 2 || Immune to petrify
|-
| 3 || Can't be run from
|-
| 4 || Multi-part enemy

|-
| 9 || Counter-attacks magic
|-
| 10 || Changes form on death
|-
| 11 || Revives after death
|-
| 12-15 || Reserved
|}

==Notes==

* Total enemy count: Approximately 120-130 unique enemies including bosses
* Enemy stats table starts at ROM $014275 (unheadered)
* Each enemy entry is exactly 74 bytes ($4a)
* Boss enemies often have multi-phase behavior with separate stat entries for each phase
* Some enemies have special scripted behaviors that override normal battle AI
