# FFMQ Control Codes Reference

**Date**: November 11, 2025  
**Status**: Research in progress - some codes confirmed, others hypothesized

---

## Overview

Final Fantasy Mystic Quest uses control codes embedded in dialog text to:
- Control text display (speed, positioning, pauses)
- Trigger game events (screen shake, music changes, character movement)
- Insert dynamic content (character names, item names)
- Control dialog flow (wait for input, clear box, new page)

This document catalogs all known and hypothesized control codes based on:
- Assembly source analysis (`src/asm/*.asm`)
- Dialog data analysis (`assets/text/dialog.asm`)
- DataCrystal/TCRF documentation
- ROM byte pattern analysis

## Assembly Source Evidence

### Bank $00 - Game Loop and Events

From `src/asm/bank_00_section2.asm`:
```asm
GameLoop_ProcessTimeEvents:
	; Process events that occur at specific time intervals
	; Checks status flags for various timed events
```

From `src/asm/bank_00_documented.asm`:
```asm
Execute_Script_Or_Command = $00b400
CODE_01B24C = $01b24c    ; Bank $01 script initialization routine
```

### Bank $08 - Text Engine

From `src/asm/bank_08_documented.asm`:
```asm
; CONTROL CODES DOCUMENTED:
; $f0 = END_STRING (most frequent, terminates all text)
; $f1 = NEWLINE (line breaks with spacing parameter)
; $f2 = CLEAR_WINDOW (clear box or scroll content)
; $f3 = SCROLL_TEXT (scroll with speed/distance parameter)
; $f4 = WAIT (pause for duration or player input)
; $f5 = COLOR/EFFECT (text color change, emphasis)
```

**Note**: Bank $08 uses different control code values (0xF0-0xF5) than dialog text (0x00-0x3B). This suggests:
- Bank $08 codes may be internal engine codes
- Dialog codes (0x00-0x3B) may be translated to engine codes
- Need to find the translation table in ROM

### Bank $03 - Text Box Positioning

From `~historical/temp_cycles/temp_bank03_cycle02.asm`:
```asm
; Text box positioning data with screen coordinates
; Format: [Box_Type] [X_Pos] [Y_Pos] [Width] [Height] [Flags]
db $03,$05,$E9,$07,$05,$44,$5F,$01,$08,$50,$86,$05,$18,$80,$10,$08
```

This shows dialog boxes have:
- X/Y screen coordinates
- Width/Height parameters
- Type flags (above/below/center)

## ROM Analysis Data

### Top Control Code Usage (from dialog.asm)

| Rank | Code | Count | % of Total | Likely Function |
|------|------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 0x00 | 245 | 48.9% | [END] - String terminator |
| 2 | 0x02 | 62 | 12.4% | [WAIT] - Button press |
| 3 | 0x03 | 60 | 12.0% | [ASTERISK] - Special marker |
| 4 | 0x06 | 40 | 8.0% | [SPACE] - Space/underscore |
| 5 | 0x01 | 37 | 7.4% | {newline} - Line break |
| 6 | 0x05 | 33 | 6.6% | [ITEM] - Item name insert |
| 7 | 0x04 | 24 | 4.8% | [NAME] - Character name |

Total analyzed: 501 control code instances across 245 dialogs

### Context Patterns

**0x02 [WAIT] often appears**:
- At end of dialog sentences before [END]
- Before dialog box clears
- After important story revelations

**0x03 [ASTERISK] often appears**:
- In repeated patterns (likely dialog box drawing)
- Mixed with 0xFE bytes (placeholder characters)

**0x05 [ITEM] and 0x04 [NAME]**:
- Surrounded by normal text bytes
- Often near the middle of dialogs
- Example: `...text [NAME] more text...`

## Reverse Engineering Priorities

### HIGH Priority (Common & Critical)

1. **0x23 [CLEAR]** - Very common, affects dialog flow
2. **0x30 [PARA]** - Common, affects text layout
3. **0x36 [PAGE]** - Common, controls multi-page dialogs
4. **0x1A/0x1B** - Dialog positioning, user-visible

### MEDIUM Priority (Functional but Less Common)

5. **0x1D/0x1E/0x1F** - Variable text insertion
6. **0x07-0x0A** - Text speed/delay (UX feature)
7. **0x10-0x22** - Event parameters (gameplay)

### LOW Priority (Rare or Unknown)

8. **0x80-0x8F** - Extended codes (rare usage)
9. **0x0B-0x0F** - Unknown codes (very rare)
10. **0x24-0x3B** - Unused or rare parameters

---

## Hypothesized Multi-Byte Commands

Some control codes may require following parameter bytes.

### Evidence from ROM

**Pattern**: Control code followed by consistent byte values

```
0x1A [TEXTBOX_BELOW] → often followed by 0x00 or 0x81
0x1B [TEXTBOX_ABOVE] → often followed by 0x81 or position byte
0x0D [possible SET_FLAG] → followed by 2 parameter bytes
```

### Suggested Format

```
Single-byte:
[0x00] = END (no parameters)
[0x02] = WAIT (no parameters)

Multi-byte (1 param):
[0x1A][param] = TEXTBOX_BELOW with position param

Multi-byte (2 params):
[0x0D][param1][param2] = SET_FLAG flag_id, flag_value
```

---

## Menu and Event Integration

### Shop/Inn/Save Menus

**Hypothesis**: Some parameter codes trigger menus.

Candidates:
- **0x20-0x2F** range - May include shop/inn triggers
- **0x32-0x35** range - May include yes/no prompts

Evidence needed:
- Analyze shop dialog IDs
- Find inn dialog IDs
- Look for prompt patterns in ROM

### Character Movement

**Hypothesis**: 0x36 [PAGE] may also trigger movement.

Evidence:
- `event_script.py` defines movement commands
- `script_editor.py` shows character position control
- Assembly shows movement linked to dialog events

Candidates:
- **0x36** - Dual purpose (page + movement trigger?)
- **0x10-0x1F** - Position/direction parameters?

### Screen Effects

**Hypothesis**: Some codes trigger visual effects.

From `event_script.py`:
```python
0x53: "FLASH_SCREEN" (color, duration)
0x54: "SHAKE_SCREEN" (duration)
0x55: "FADE_OUT"
0x56: "FADE_IN"
```

These engine commands may be triggered by dialog codes in 0x10-0x3B range.

## Next Steps for Research

### 1. ROM Disassembly Analysis

**Target**: Find the control code dispatch table

```asm
; Expected pattern (from bank $00 or $08):
ControlCodeTable:
	.dw Handler_00  ; END
	.dw Handler_01  ; NEWLINE
	.dw Handler_02  ; WAIT
	; ... etc
```

**Tools**:
- IDA Pro / Ghidra disassembly
- Search for pointer tables in bank $00/$08
- Look for JSR/JMP indirect instructions

### 2. Dialog Context Extraction

**Create tool** to extract control code contexts:
```python
# For each control code:
#   - Which dialogs use it?
#   - What text surrounds it?
#   - What byte patterns follow it?
#   - How often in same dialog?
```

**Output**: `reports/control_code_contexts.md`

### 3. Event Script Correlation

**Cross-reference**:
- Dialog IDs with event scripts
- Map events with dialogs containing specific codes
- Find event triggers (battle, shop, movement)

### 4. ROM Patching Tests

**Method**: Modify control code values and observe effects

```
Test 1: Change 0x1A parameter → Does box position change?
Test 2: Change 0x36 usage → Does movement trigger?
Test 3: Remove 0x23 → Does box stay displayed?
```

### 5. Emulator Debugging

**Use**: Mesen2 / BSNES debugger

**Steps**:
1. Set breakpoint on text engine
2. Step through control code handling
3. Watch registers for parameter reads
4. Trace function calls

| **CMD:10** | **16,321** | 48 | CMD:0F (2,456), CMD:08 (1,892) | ❓ Unknown |
| **CMD:0B** | **12,507** | 53 | CMD:0B (1,292), CMD:08 (696) | ❓ Unknown |
| **CMD:0C** | **7,925** | 52 | CMD:08 (892), CMD:0B (654) | ❓ Unknown |
| **CMD:0E** | **4,972** | 47 | CMD:08 (578), CMD:0B (445) | ❓ Unknown |
| **CMD:0D** | **3,908** | 45 | CMD:08 (456), CMD:0B (334) | ❓ Unknown |

#### Medium-Frequency Control Codes

| Code | Total Uses | Dialogs | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|
| CMD:03 | 3,040 | 42 | Often followed by CMD:08 |
| CMD:07 | 3,622 | 38 | Often followed by CMD:08 |
| CMD:0F | 2,456 | 36 | Often followed by CMD:10 |
| CMD:01 | 1,867 | 30 | Confirmed: {newline} |
| CMD:02 | 1,245 | 28 | Confirmed: [WAIT] |

#### Low-Frequency Control Codes

| Code | Total Uses | Dialogs | Status |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|
| CMD:04 | 724 | 24 | Confirmed: [NAME] |
| CMD:05 | 633 | 23 | Confirmed: [ITEM] |
| CMD:06 | 540 | 21 | Confirmed: [SPACE] |

| CMD:1B | 332 | 15 | Confirmed: [TEXTBOX_ABOVE] |
| CMD:1F | 289 | 12 | Confirmed: [CRYSTAL] |

### Analysis Findings

#### Pattern 1: Recursive Control Codes
**CMD:0B** appears to call itself recursively (1,292 self-references out of 12,507 total uses). This suggests:
- May be a loop/repeat command
- May control dialog flow state machine
- Requires assembly analysis to confirm

#### Pattern 2: Command Sequences
Common sequences found across dialogs:
```
CMD:08 → CMD:07 (3,622 occurrences)
CMD:08 → CMD:03 (3,040 occurrences)
CMD:10 → CMD:0F (2,456 occurrences)
CMD:0B → CMD:0B (1,292 occurrences - recursive!)
```

#### Pattern 3: Dialog-Specific Codes
Some codes appear only in specific dialog contexts:
- **CMD:10** appears primarily in story-heavy dialogs
- **CMD:1A/1B** appear in character dialog scenes (positioning)
- **CMD:1F** appears in location-specific dialogs (Crystal references)

### Research Priorities

Based on usage frequency, prioritize documenting these codes:

1. **🔥 CRITICAL: CMD:08** (20,715 uses)
   - Most used code in entire system
   - Analyze handler at jump table offset
   - Test in emulator with isolated dialogs

2. **🔥 HIGH: CMD:10** (16,321 uses)
   - Second most used
   - Often paired with CMD:0F

3. **🔥 HIGH: CMD:0B** (12,507 uses)
   - Recursive behavior suggests complex function
   - Self-references indicate state management

4. **⚠️ MEDIUM: CMD:0C, CMD:0E, CMD:0D** (7,925 + 4,972 + 3,908 = 16,805 uses)
   - Combined usage very high
   - Likely core dialog system functions

### Analysis Tools

1. **`tools/analysis/analyze_control_codes_detailed.py`**
   - Tracks every control code occurrence
   - Shows 3-byte context (before/after)
   - Identifies following byte patterns
   - Generated 546KB comprehensive report

2. **`tools/ffmq_text.py analyze-controls`**
   - Unified CLI for control code analysis
   - Quick statistics and frequency counts

3. **ROM Data:**
   - Jump table: $00:9E0E (48 handler addresses)
   - Handler code: Bank $00 (various locations)
   - Dialog data: Bank $03:A000-FFFF

### Next Steps

To achieve 100% control code documentation:

1. **Assembly Analysis**
   - Locate jump table at $00:9E0E in `bank_00_documented.asm`
   - Follow each of 48 handler addresses
   - Document what each handler does
   - Map handlers to control code bytes

2. **Emulator Testing**
   - Create test dialogs with isolated control codes
   - Observe behavior in Mesen-S with debugger
   - Document visual/functional effects
   - Verify hypotheses from assembly

3. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Analyze common sequences (CMD:08→CMD:07, etc.)
   - Identify context patterns (when codes used)
   - Map to game events (battles, shops, story)

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update this file with findings
   - Add named tags to `import_complex_text.py`
   - Create quick reference table
   - Add usage examples
