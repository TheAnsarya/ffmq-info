# Analyzing unknown bytes from dictionary
# Based on context and patterns in the extracted text

# Current unknowns and their likely values:
# 0x80 - appears in entry 0x7F (garbage entry)
# 0x81 - appears in entry 0x61  
# 0x83 - appears after CMD:08 commands
# 0x84 - appears after CMD:08 commands and letters
# 0x87, 0x8A, 0x8B, 0x8C - appear in entry 0x7F and 0x62 (seem like garbage)
# 0xCE - appears before newline and dictionary refs
# 0xD0 - entry 0x4D shows "D0 FF" - likely a letter + space
# 0xD2 - appears multiple times, in entry 0x53 as "D2 D2 D2" (repeating char)
# 0xDC, 0xDE, 0xEB - appear in entry 0x7F
# 0xE7, 0xF7 - appear after CMD:08

# Let's look at the font tilemap pattern:
# 90-99 = 0-9
# 9A-B3 = A-Z
# B4-CD = a-z
# D1 = '
# DA = -
# DB = &
# FF = space

# So the pattern for lower/upper case is clear
# Missing characters are likely punctuation

# Looking at common SNES character tables:
80=@      # Special symbol
81=!      # Exclamation  
82=?      # Question mark
83=(      # Left paren
84=)      # Right paren
85=[      # Left bracket
86=]      # Right bracket
87=:      # Colon
88=;      # Semicolon
89=.      # Period
8A=,      # Comma
8B=<      # Less than
8C=>      # Greater than
8D=/      # Slash
8E=\      # Backslash
8F=+      # Plus

CE=.      # Period (alternate or specific use)
CF=,      # Comma (alternate)
D0=!      # Exclamation (alternate)
D2=.      # Period (repeating pattern suggests ellipsis)
D3=?      # Question (alternate)
DC=.      # Period
DD=,      # Comma
DE=!      # Exclamation
DF=?      # Question
E0=:      # Colon
E7='      # Apostrophe/quote
EB=.      # Period
F7="      # Quote mark
